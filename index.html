                I'm a coder-in-training named Ryan! I have a bachelor's degree 
                in mass communications, and have worked in the fast paced 
                journalism world as a reporter, as well as a closed captioner.
                <br>
                <br>
                After realizing that the media world isn't for me, I decided to 
                pursue a career in the growing and in-demand field of web development.
                This portfolio will give you an idea of what magic I can work!
